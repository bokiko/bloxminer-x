# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # khs and stats (set far below) are read by the Hive agent that sources this
	# file - this directive must stay file-level (before any code at all) to cover both, so it moved up here
	# when the deadline fallback block below became the file's first actual statement.
# Sourced by the Hive agent: must set $khs (total kH/s) and $stats (JSON). ONE shared 3.0 s deadline for the
# whole run, computed fresh every time this file is sourced - there is no dispatcher above it (BloxMiner-X is a
# single-engine package: this file IS the one and only poll entry point Hive ever calls).
#
# Release 1.0.1: an earlier version of this file required /2/summary AND /2/backends AND the full per-core
# enrichment pass to all succeed in the SAME poll before reporting any positive rate at all - a reply of "0" was
# reported whenever Phase B (the richer per-core breakdown) did not finish in time, even though XMRig's own
# /2/summary alone already answers "how fast, right now, honestly" with one cheap call. Split into two phases:
#   Phase A (mandatory, cheap): ownership check (unchanged) + ONE curl to /2/summary alone. XMRig's own
#     `hashrate.total[0]` there is already the aggregate rate, `connection.accepted/rejected` and `uptime` are
#     right there too. Written to $OUTFILE the moment it is ready, as a single row.
#   Phase B (optional, whatever budget remains): /2/backends + bloxsense + per-core binding verification - a
#     richer per-core (or per-thread) breakdown, still recomputed from data collected THIS SAME poll, never a
#     substitute for Phase A's answer if it does not finish in time. Only a display detail is allowed to age:
#     the single row's temperature, when Phase B does not run this poll, may reuse the last real temperature
#     Phase B measured for this exact xmrig instance (pid + /proc start time), bounded to ENRICH_MAX_AGE_S -
#     never the rate, which is either fresh this poll or 0.
# So a poll's answer is always either genuinely fresh (this exact API call, this exact poll) or the defined 0 -
# there is no cache of the number that actually matters left to reason about an age bound for.
#
# The whole collection still runs inside a single, ONE-absolute-deadline, killable child: a /proc scan on a rig
# with an unusually large process table, or any other step, can never make this script overrun its budget,
# because the whole child is killed outright if it does not finish in time. Both /proc scans (ownership,
# task-mask) do ONE fork total each, regardless of how many fds/tasks exist: `find -lname` and a single `awk`
# do their own comparisons in-process instead of forking readlink/sed per item - a per-item loop here
# previously cost a real rig a hard fallback (~870 fds, all 32 threads mining, budget blown mid-scan under that
# fork load; an idle dev box never showed it).
# That child runs via `setsid`, its own dedicated session/process group, with an explicit TERM-then-KILL
# escalation below targeting that whole group (SIGTERM at 2.4 s, SIGKILL at 2.7 s if that is ignored -
# unmaskable, so nothing outlives it) - plain `timeout` was tried first and found NOT reliable here: when the
# collection nests its own `timeout` call for bloxsense, GNU timeout's own signal only ever reaches its direct
# child, not that nested timeout's descendants, so a bloxsense (or curl) that ignores SIGTERM could survive as
# an orphan after this script returns. `setsid` plus our own `kill -- -$pgid` reaches every descendant, tested.
# That pgid is NEVER read by this script itself via `ps` right after backgrounding the child - immediately
# after fork, the new process can still be running with our OWN (inherited) pgid for a brief window before it
# reaches its own setsid() call, and a group-kill against a pgid read during that window could hit our own
# caller instead of the collection. Instead, the child reports its OWN pgid into a handshake file, written
# only after its setsid has taken effect; a kill is only ever sent to a group when that handshake has arrived
# and reads back exactly the child's own pid, and differs from our own pgid and from 0/1 - anything else,
# including the handshake simply not having arrived yet, signals the child's own pid alone, never a group.
# $OUTFILE is written to DIRECTLY by run() (atomically, tmp+rename) at each phase boundary - never captured
# from the child's stdout - so a kill mid-Phase-B can never erase Phase A's already-written, honest answer;
# read back from a temp file rather than a pipe, so a would-be survivor holding a pipe open can never hang it.
# Inside the child, the remaining time is still recomputed before every step, and each step is additionally
# capped at its own nominal ceiling (curl 0.5 s, bloxsense 1.0 s) so a slow but not-yet-killed step cannot
# starve the ones after it more than necessary.
# Before trusting 127.0.0.1:$API_PORT at all, this checks that the listening socket belongs to OUR xmrig
# (its pid's /proc/<pid>/exe is this package's ./xmrig) - a foreign miner bound to the same port is never read.
# Both API replies are schema-checked before use (object/array shape, numeric affinity, array hashrate) -
# a reply that merely looks like JSON but not like XMRig's own shape is treated the same as no reply. Even a
# schema-valid rate is clamped to 0 if it is not a finite, non-negative number: hs is never negative.
# Rows: one per physical core (SMT threads summed from /2/backends' per-thread affinity + hashrate[0], 10 s
# window) when every thread reports a real affinity to a CPU bloxsense's topology also knows, AND the xmrig
# process's own task list (/proc/<pid>/task/*/status) shows that exact multiset of single-CPU-pinned tasks -
# i.e. the binding is independently confirmed, not just asserted by the API. Otherwise one row per thread
# (Phase B, unverified binding) or one row = the total (Phase A only, no per-core breakdown collected this
# poll) with the package temperature. A row's rate is XMRig's own 10 s average; it drops to 0 within ~10-20 s
# of hashing stopping - this is not a "completed work" stamp. khs is always the sum of rows.
# State changes (unavailable / shallow / affinity not verified / recovered) get one timestamped line in this
# package's OWN log, $CUSTOM_LOG_BASENAME.stats.log - never in XMRig's own log file, and never on stdout (this
# file is sourced by Hive's agent, not run as a standalone script). XMRig's FileLogWriter opens its log with
# O_CREAT|O_WRONLY (no O_APPEND) and tracks its own write offset from the size at open time: anything else
# appended to that same file is silently overwritten by XMRig's own next write, so a second writer's lines
# never survive there - confirmed on a live rig (state transitions really happened, per the state file, but no
# diagnostic line was ever found in XMRig's log or its rotated copies). The stats log is bounded to its last
# ~200 lines once it passes 1 MiB.
# Reset $khs/$stats UNCONDITIONALLY, before any other work - the very first thing this poll does. Hive's
# real agent sources this file repeatedly in the SAME shell, poll after poll; $khs/$stats are plain global
# variables, so anything that leaves them untouched (rather than explicitly assigning, even to the honest 0)
# would let a PREVIOUS poll's values silently stand as THIS poll's answer - a positive rate surviving a
# stalled/dead poll right after it. Cleared here means the rest of this file can never "forget" to answer.

	# separate `jq -nc` compose call - see the P1 finding below) - real-Hive evidence (1 CPU, 32 threads all
	# saturating it) is that every avoided fork here matters, so this phase forks only what curl/find/awk/

	# at a flat, small ceiling, since skipping any of THEM is always a safe fallback to Phase A's own total),
	# killing this call early has no such safe fallback: it is how Phase A gets its answer at all. A P1 finding
	# (bot review): a flat 0.5 s ceiling here killed a healthy-but-slow XMRig HTTP API under genuine CPU
	# pressure (its own process, not just this one - a real cause of false zeros even with most of the 2.4 s
	# budget still unused) - the SAME lesson this file's own fork-free design already learned elsewhere (a cap
	# chosen to assume the worst, rather than derived from what is actually left, kills an honest-but-slow
	# answer for no reason). PHASE_A_CURL_RESERVE_US is SUBTRACTED from whatever remains, never a flat ceiling
	# against it.
	#
	# A SECOND P1 finding (bot review, after the first fix above): even with the curl itself budgeted correctly,
	# the fixed reserve covering the WORK AFTER curl returns was sized by assumption, not measurement, and
	# originally had to cover TWO separate jq forks (one to parse, one more `jq -nc` to compose the final JSON) -
	# under the exact CPU saturation this reserve exists for, that second, avoidable fork was real risk the
	# reserve was gambling would still fit. Composing the stats JSON is now folded into the SAME jq invocation
	# that parses/validates/extracts (below) - the fork count this reserve must cover is cut from two to one.
	# MEASURED (not assumed): a standalone harness ran this exact merged filter, pinned (taskset -c) to ONE CPU
	# core that four busy loops (K=4, same oversubscription convention tests/hive/test_under_load.sh now uses)
	# were ALSO pinned to, 200 iterations - max observed fork+parse+compose cost was 12.0 ms on ai02 (bare metal,
	# 24 cores; avg 8.0 ms). ai02 has never reproduced the GitHub Actions hard-cap failures this reserve exists
	# to prevent (GH's shared/throttled runners are demonstrably worse - see the CI trace instrumentation added
	# for that failure), so this is not the raw measurement alone: it is that measurement with a documented,
	# wide (~25x) safety multiplier, landing at the same 0.3 s this reserve already used - not a smaller number
	# chosen to match the gentler of the two known environments, but the SAME number now justified by an actual
