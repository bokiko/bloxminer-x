#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Sourced by the Hive agent: must set $khs (total kH/s) and $stats (JSON). ONE shared 3.0 s deadline for the
# whole run, enforced by running the ENTIRE collection (the /proc ownership scan, both API calls, the /proc
# task-mask scan, bloxsense, and the jq row assembly) inside a single child process, not just individual
# steps: a /proc scan on a rig with an unusually large process table, or any other step, can never make this
# script overrun its budget, because the whole child is killed outright if it does not finish in time. Both
# /proc scans (ownership, task-mask) do ONE fork total each, regardless of how many fds/tasks exist: `find
# -lname` and a single `awk` do their own comparisons in-process instead of forking readlink/sed per item - a
# per-item loop here previously cost a real rig a hard fallback (~870 fds, all 32 threads mining, budget blown
# mid-scan under that fork load; an idle dev box never showed it).
# That child runs via `setsid`, its own dedicated session/process group, with an explicit TERM-then-KILL
# escalation below targeting that whole group (SIGTERM at 2.4 s, SIGKILL at 2.7 s if that is ignored -
# unmaskable, so nothing outlives it) - plain `timeout` was tried first and found NOT reliable here: when the
# collection nests its own `timeout` call for bloxsense, GNU timeout's own signal only ever reaches its direct
# child, not that nested timeout's descendants, so a bloxsense (or curl) that ignores SIGTERM could survive as
# an orphan after this script returns. `setsid` plus our own `kill -- -$pgid` reaches every descendant, tested.
# That pgid is NEVER read by this script itself via `ps` right after backgrounding the child - immediately
# after fork, the new process can still be running with our OWN (inherited) pgid for a brief window before it
# reaches its own setsid() call, and a group-kill against a pgid read during that window could hit our own
# caller instead of the collection. Instead, the child reports its OWN pgid into a handshake file, written
# only after its setsid has taken effect; a kill is only ever sent to a group when that handshake has arrived
# and reads back exactly the child's own pid, and differs from our own pgid and from 0/1 - anything else,
# including the handshake simply not having arrived yet, signals the child's own pid alone, never a group.
# The parent (this file) always has a defined answer ready (the fallback below) for when the child is killed,
# read back from a temp file rather than a pipe, so a would-be survivor holding a pipe open can never hang it.
# Inside the child, the remaining time is still recomputed before every step, and each step is additionally
# capped at its own nominal ceiling (curl 0.5 s, bloxsense 1.0 s) so a slow but not-yet-killed step cannot
# starve the ones after it more than necessary.
# Before trusting 127.0.0.1:$API_PORT at all, this checks that the listening socket belongs to OUR xmrig
# (its pid's /proc/<pid>/exe is this package's ./xmrig) - a foreign miner bound to the same port is never read.
# Both API replies are schema-checked before use (object/array shape, numeric affinity, array hashrate) -
# a reply that merely looks like JSON but not like XMRig's own shape is treated the same as no reply. Even a
# schema-valid rate is clamped to 0 if it is not a finite, non-negative number: hs is never negative.
# Rows: one per physical core (SMT threads summed from /2/backends' per-thread affinity + hashrate[0], 10 s
# window) when every thread reports a real affinity to a CPU bloxsense's topology also knows, AND the xmrig
# process's own task list (/proc/<pid>/task/*/status) shows that exact multiset of single-CPU-pinned tasks -
# i.e. the binding is independently confirmed, not just asserted by the API. Otherwise one row per thread with
# the package temperature (the core mapping is "unbound"). A row's rate is XMRig's own 10 s average; it drops
# to 0 within ~10-20 s of hashing stopping - this is not a "completed work" stamp. khs is always the sum of rows.
# State changes (API unavailable / affinity not verified / recovered) get one line in the miner log, never on
# stdout (this file is sourced by Hive's agent, not run as a standalone script).
# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # khs and stats are read by the Hive agent that sources this file
